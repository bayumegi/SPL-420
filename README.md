# YOLOMIGOS
1000 diamond-handed gigachads inscribed directly on the Solana blockchain ðŸ’ŽâœŠ You only live once but Solscriptions are forever. YOLO! (Not affiliated with WSB. For anons, by anons).

### Self incribing, First is first
How to:
- The Order is a self incribe collection, only the first confirmed inscription of each image is counted as part of the collection.
- You can check a YOLOMIGO's availability by using the check button below its image.
- The status of the YOLOMIGO will appear on the bottom right of the page, if its free; right click save and inscribe using the SPL-420 standards.
- Confirmed Taken YOLOMIGOS will appear greyed out, updates on confirmed taken YOLOMIGOS will happen periodically.
- Always use the check button as some YOLOMIGOS will be inscribed but not be confirmed taken.
